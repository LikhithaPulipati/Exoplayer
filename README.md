# Exoplayer
The Project mainly deals with ExoPlayer in  which the  standard audio and video components are built on Androidâ€™s Media Codec API.


**ExoPlayer**

**Activity lifecycle**
    we'll integrate ExoPlayer properly into the activity lifecycle to support proper app back-/
    foregrounding and playback resumption in single or multi-window environment/mode.
    
    **UI components** 
    
      we'll use standard ExoPlayer UI components and customize such components and the activity to fit to our needs in different APKs 
      like for mobile, Android Instant Apps.
